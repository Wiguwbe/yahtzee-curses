# Yahtzee

_Yahtzee_ game implemented for both multiplayer and singleplayer
(does single player even make sense?), with online multiplayer in mind
for future iterations.

Requires ncurses to build (and libmath).

Game interface should be simple enough to use.

Rules based on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee).
